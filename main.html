            <td>Decentraland (MANA) defines itself as a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications.In this virtual world, users purchase plots of land that they can later navigate, build upon and monetize.Decentraland was launched following a $24 million initial coin offering (ICO) that was conducted in 2017. The virtual world launched its closed beta in 2019 and opened to the public in February 2020. Since then, users have created a wide range of experiences on their parcels of LAND, including interactive games, sprawling 3D scenes and a variety of other interactive experiences.Decentraland uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an ERC-20 token that must be burned to acquire non-fungible ERC-721 LAND tokens. MANA tokens can also be used to pay for a range of avatars, wearables, names, and more on the Decentraland marketplace.Decentraland (MANA) is a decentralized virtual world platform with software based on the Ethereum blockchain, where users create, test and monetize content. In short: users buy virtual plots of land as NFTs with MANA tokens on the Decentraland platform. Progress in the game depends only on players themselves, their efforts and their imagination.The digital platform is completely owned by its users. Within the Decentraland metaverse, participants can explore the virtual world, purchase plots of land that can be monetized, create works of art, own non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and take part in a decentralized autonomous organization of the platform Decentraland DAO. Due to the DAO, the community influences the development vector of the project.In addition, users have access to interactive applications, in-world payments and peer-to-peer communication. The 3D world resonates with many participants as Decentraland has many applications, both entertainment for gamers and business for investors.Two types of tokens called MANA and LAND govern operations in Decentraland. They also allow users to interact with the platform.MANA is the official currency of Decentraland. It’s an ERC-20 standard token that powers the Decentraland platform. With MANA, users can purchase plots of LAND, as well as pay for in-game items and services.MANA gives its holders the right to vote in Decentraland DAO. MANA can be purchased on a cryptocurrency exchange or by selling collectibles on Decentraland Marketplace. The owner of tokens converts them to wrapped MANA, or wMANA, and then commits them to the DAO. One wMANA equals one vote. MANA can be exchanged for fiat currency and other digital assets.As for LAND, it’s a non-fungible token (NFT) based on Ethereum (ETH). It is used to track ownership of land parcels aka digital real estate. Like MANA, LAND is part of the protocol and confers voting rights, but LAND does not need to be fixed in the DAO. One LAND is equal to two thousand votes.Players choose what to do with their land. Owners store tokens in crypto wallets and buy necessities with MANA tokens on the Decentraland Marketplace. Moreover, on the marketplace, participants can manage or exchange LAND tokens (priced in MANA). Holders use the marketplace to transact or transfer in-game items. All transactions are conducted, regulated and registered via the Ethereum blockchain.Decentraland combines an online gaming space and blockchain technology. All control over the rules is given to the players, and token holders vote on in-game and organizational policies. The original goal was to form a decentralized virtual reality, but in practice, Decentraland has turned into a massive NFT market.A special role in Decentraland is assigned to NFTs, such as collectibles, virtual equipment and real estate (LAND). However, for new players who want to join the universe and seize NFTs, the entry barrier will be high.The Decentraland protocol is built on three levels using Ethereum smart contracts. On the consensus layer, the ownership of LAND is tracked and managed. The land content layer displays the content of the Decentraland virtual world. Finally, on the real-time layer, participants interact with each other.The platform was co-founded by two blockchain experts, Ari Meilich and Esteban Ordano, in 2015. Officially it was launched a year later and became available only in February 2020, gradually turning from a 2D experiment into a full-fledged 3D world.To sum up, Decentraland is a decentralized game and a 3D virtual reality platform where players own lands and create limitlessly. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) software is at the core, and governance is in the hands of the community. Through the native token MANA, players participate in any proposals for managing and improving the ecosystem, the auction system, and the in-game policy.</td>

            <td>What Is Axie Infinity (AXS)?Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that is partially owned and operated by its players.To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Axie Infinity.Inspired by popular games like Pokémon and Tamagotchi, Axie Infinity allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as Axies.These Axies can take various forms, and there are more than 500 different body parts available, including aquatic, beast, bird, bug, plant and reptile parts. Parts from each type class come in four different rarity scales: common, rare, ultra rare and legendary — and Axies can have any combination of body parts, making them highly variable and often rare and unique.Each Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT) with different attributes and strengths and can be entered into 3v3 battles, with the winning team earning more experience (exp) points that are used to level up an Axie's stats or evolve their body parts. These Axies can be bred together to produce new and unique offspring, which can be used or sold on the Axie marketplace.The Axie Infinity ecosystem also has its own unique governance token, known as Axie Infinity Shards (AXS). These are used to participate in key governance votes and will give holders a say in how funds in the Axie Community Treasury are spent.Who Are the Founders of Axie Infinity?Axie Infinity was created in 2018 by Sky Mavis — a technology-focused game developer with a team primarily based in Vietnam. It was co-founded by Trung Nguyen and Aleksander Larsen.Trung Nguyen is the current CEO of the platform. Nguyen graduated with a BS in computer software engineering, and worked as a software engineer at Anduin Transactions prior to founding Axie Infinity.Former competitive gamer Aleksander Larsen is also credited as a co-founder and COO of the platform. Larsen has been working in blockchain gaming since 2017. He previously worked as the executive security officer for the Norwegian Government Security Organization and still sits as Secretary of the Board of Directors at the Blockchain Game Alliance.In total, the Axie Infinity team consists of 25 full-time employees — many of whom have experience with game development.What Makes Axie Infinity Unique?Each Axie possesses six out of the hundreds of different potential body parts — each of which has its own battle move. This produces essentially endless variety among Axies, with most Axies having relatively weak statistics, while those with the strongest combination of body parts can have incredible stats.Unlike some other blockchain-based battling and breeding games, each Axie can only be bred a total of seven times to help control the population of Axies.Axie Infinity has its own mating hub to help players find a suitable match to breed their Axie with to stand the best chance at producing a rare or powerful offspring. It costs 0.005 ETH in addition to Small Love Potion (SLP) tokens to breed Axies.AXS token holders will soon be able to stake their tokens to receive regular rewards. But unlike some other stakeable assets, AXS holders will also need to vote and play to claim their rewards.Axie Infinity GameplayAxie Infinity invites users to earn tokens through all sorts of aspects of gameplay. It also allows players to breed, grow and trade ecosystem game characters aka non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – Axie creatures. Those virtual pets have their own class, particular characteristics and a set of attributes. Axies are collectible and can also be sold on the in-game marketplace called P2P Axie. Axies are made up of a set of stats as class and body parts, indicating their features and rarity level. Distinctive ability cards that are directly related to a configuration of characteristics are the center of the gameplay. Each Axie is a unique NFT owned and controlled by its user.Play-to-Earn ModelAxie Infinity is one of the pioneers of the Play-to-Earn (P2E) concept, where gamers earn crypto and NFTs through gaming activity. As part of the online game, users participate in turn-based battles, but the main difference is that gamers have control over their characters, land plots, resources and other in-game items of the universe. Thus, Axie Infinity is an open digital universe, where the economy is controlled by its players.Ownership of in-game assets and unique digital items is verified via NFTs. The tokens act as a receipt proving the right to property. Hence, users can both sell their Axies to other players and store them securely in crypto wallets like Trust Wallet, Binance Chain Wallet, or Ronin Wallet. The last one was specially designed for Axie Infinity.How Does Axie Infinity Work?The gameplay of Axie Infinity is focused on fighting & breeding Axies. It consists of the following steps: buying Axies, participating in battles with other players, breeding Axies, and selling them on the marketplace.Players need to have an Axie to join the battle and select Adventure Mode (PvE) or Arena Mode (PvP). Axies can be bred, but each Axie cannot be bred more than 7 times. Lunacia is the homeland of digital creatures. It is divided into tokenized parts where players can search for resources and upgrade their plots. On the marketplace, players can trade their Axies and land plots. A key feature of Axie Infinity is community engagement, where each member contributes, participates in governance, and generates content. The developers have also introduced a number of mechanics that distinguish Axie Infinity from its analogs. For instance, built-in population control. Furthermore, a wide range of Axies due to various combinations of attributes builds additional demand among gamers and collectors of rare NFTs.To solve the scalability problem, Axie Infinity created its sidechain on Ethereum called Ronin Network. It ensures instant transactions not involving the Ethereum blockchain. Users can safely store AXS and collectible NFTs in Ethereum and Ronin wallets, and send tokens from Ethereum wallet to Ronin wallet via Ronin Bridge.Related Pages:Check out Ethereum (ETH) — the blockchain that hosts the Axie Infinity game.Check out Small Love Potion (SLP) — the token needed to breed Axies.Read about non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.Want to keep track of Axie Infinity prices live?

AXS is the central mechanism for running the Axie Infinity game. Players can buy, trade and earn tokens simply by playing it. In addition, the best players of the season receive rewards in AXS. Moreover, AXS serves as a governance token that allows holders to vote on gameplay changes and influence the evolution of the platform.Axie Infinity (AXS) tokens have a total supply of 270 million tokens. Out of this, around 53.5 million tokens were in circulation as of mid-November 2020.In total, 11% of the total supply was allocated to participants in the Binance Launchpad IEO sale (each Axie Infinity token price was $0.10) and 4% was sold in a private sale. In addition to this, 29% is allocated for staking rewards, 20% to the play-to-earn pool, 21% to the team, 7% to advisors and 8% to the ecosystem fund.Based on the current release schedule, as indicated by Binance Research, 100% of AXS tokens will be circulating by early 2026.How Is the Axie Infinity Network Secured?The Axie Infinity (AXS) token is an ERC-20 token launched on the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, it is secured by Ethereum’s proof-of-work (POW) consensus mechanism.In early 2021, Axie Infinity plans to migrate its NFT tokens, including Axies, Land and other in-game item tokens from the Loom Network to a custom-built sidechain on Ethereum known as Ronin.Ronin is an application-specific sidechain built just for Axie Infinity. It is being developed by Sky Mavis — the development firm behind the Axie Infinity game, and is designed to support almost instant transaction confirmations, reduced gas fees and be capable of helping Axie Infinity scale.Where Can You Buy Axie Infinity (AXS)?As of October 2021, Axie Infinity (AXS) is available to trade on numerous exchange platforms, including top exchanges like: Binance, Huobi Global, Coinbase, Bithumb, KuCoin, Gate.io and Kraken.The link between Axie Infinity Smooth Love Potion has lead to numerous trading pairs being offered, including SLP to ETH and SLP to BNB. However there is substantial interest in the Philippines for the SLP to PHP price, in Australia for the SLP to AUD and Europe for the SLP to EUR prices.It is listed with numerous Axie Infinity price pairs, including popular ones like: AXS/USDT, AXS/BTC, AXS/BUSD and AXS/BNB. As the game has risen in popularity, interest in the AXS to PHP, AXS to AUD and AXS to EUR.</td>

            <td>WILD powers Wilder World. WILD is the utility token used to: a) Identify, b) Trade, c) Generate Resources and d) Govern Wilder World. IDENTITYEvery human, NPC, asset, object and DAO inside the Wilder World Metaverse requires a unique, scarce and cryptographically secure Wilder ID, which lives on the Ethereum blockchain and Zero Protocol. Examples include: citizens, vehicles, buildings, kicks, crafts, clothing, land as well as organizations (DAOs), such as stores, dealerships, concert halls, neighborhoods and condominium associations. When a new asset is minted inside Wilder World it is secured and referenced with a unique Wilder ID (such as 0://wilder.crafts.genesis.501).A Wilder ID directly references a person, asset, or DAO and is 100% unique—meaning that no one can ever replicate, copy, or spoof it without owning it. Staking WILD is required to mint a Wilder ID. As citizens immigrate to Wilder World, new goods, manufacturing, services and DAOs are created, in turn requiring more Wilder IDs and removing WILD from circulation. TRADESimilar to a real world nation, manufacturing (minting), buying and selling assets inside Wilder World requires WILD. All global trade is denominated in WILD, along with a transaction fee of 2% that is charged in WILD and automatically transferred to the Wilder Nation DAO.RESOURCESCreating (minting) new objects inside the Wilder World Metaverse requires energy in the form of raw materials. Citizens can harness raw materials from the earth and process them at refineries, which can later be converted into useful goods and services that expand the Wilder Nation’s GDP and use of WILD.GOVERNANCEWilder World is 100% owned and governed by Citizens of the Wilder Nation. An open and decentralized metaverse that is for the people and by the people. Wilders vote in governance proposals related to the all global topics, propositions and critical decisions. Voting requires that each Citizen hold a valid Wilder ID (such as 0://wilder.frank), as well as at least 1 WILD token.Wilder World was created by Zero Tech and is built on the Zero Protocol, Ethereum and Unreal Engine 5.</td>

            <td>What Is My Neighbor Alice (ALICE)?My Neighbor Alice is a farming-themed play-to-earn builder game built on Chromia. The game bills itself as a place where “players can buy and own virtual islands, collect and build exciting items while also making new friends.” Each player has their own avatar representing them in the game, which they can modify as they please. Players can buy virtual real estate from Alice, the game’s eponymous central figure, or the internal marketplace. All purchased land is represented as an NFT. My Neighbor Alice aims to introduce blockchain to millions of players and targets a diverse gaming community within the traditional gaming market. Although the game is blockchain-based and integrates DeFi features, it does not require prior knowledge of cryptocurrency and blockchain. My Neighbor Alice takes inspiration from several popular sources. For instance, daily in-game tasks and social aspects are inspired by Animal Crossing, whereas Minecraft serves as a role model for building mechanics. The artwork was inspired by the Swedish children’s book Pettson and Findus. Who Are the Founders of My Neighbor Alice?My Neighbor Alice was built by Antler Interactive, a Swedish interactive mobile game studio. Antler Interactive was previously known as SVRVIVE Studios, a pioneer in VR that released titles like SVRVIVE: The Deus Helix, Kartong - Death by Cardboard, Krystal Kart AR, Krystopia: A Puzzle Journey, Krystopia, and Nova’s Journey. In 2019, Antler Interactive was acquired by ChromaWay, a blockchain development company that is behind the Chromia blockchain. Thus far, the game has amassed $2.1 million in two rounds of funding from VC funds like Coin98 Ventures, Kyros Ventures and raised $100,000 in an IDO round on DAO Maker.What Makes My Neighbor Alice Unique?My Neighbor Alice aims to set itself apart in two ways. First, its unique style that incorporates the character of Alice as a relatable “in-game friend” makes the game more personable to casual players that are not familiar with classic blockchain gaming features. In addition, the game does not force players to interact with the underlying blockchain technology, although it allows those who are curious to explore classic DeFi functionality. Players can engage in various activities designed to appeal to the game’s wide target audience, including women. The central game feature is virtual islands, of which there are six: Snowflake IslandMedieval RestNature’s RestLummestadSandy CoastSubmerged IslandPlayers can buy virtual land in the form of NFT tokens on these islands and decorate it with in-game items like houses, lakes, decorations, animals, plants, and others. Players are represented by their avatars, which can also be customized with in-game items. All of those are tradeable through the marketplace or marketplaces on other blockchains. Moreover, players can boost their reputation by completing quests and activities in the game. Shared quests enable players to work on a common goal and participate in community-created events that can be discussed on the gme#s decentralized forum. The game’s developers recently announced an $80 million Metaverse Grant Program that will support the most promising ideas to expand the game’s metaverse.

It can also serve to generate revenue if a player decides to charge other players for visiting their virtual island. Players can also stake ALICE to unlock special quests, but only if players meet a certain staking threshold. They can also earn ALICE for completing quests and accumulating experience points for the token. Finally, token holders can use ALICE to vote in governance proposals. The total supply of ALICE is 100 million according to the following distribution:Token sale (21%)Reserve (20%): used for staking rewards.Ecosystem (16%)Community & Marketing (15%)Team (15%)Platform reward (8%): in-game rewards.User incentive (5%)How Is the My Neighbor Alice Network Secured?My Neighbor Alice is built on Chromia, a layer-one blockchain used in conjunction with Unity to operate accounts, token transfers, relational data, and user progress. Chromia follows the development of cross-chain playability, with its unique database aspects allowing for complex back-end logic directly on the blockchain.The second layer to the game is Unity. This front-end solution is, in large part, a procedural building system connecting the back-end with login-registration edge case and multiplayer scalability. ALICE is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchains and the go-to solution for many decentralized applications. Its’ proof-of-work consensus mechanism requires miners to mine new Ether and ensures that Ethereum is one of the safest blockchains in the crypto industry. A set of decentralized nodes validates transactions and secures the Ethereum blockchain.Where Can You Buy My Neighbor Alice (ALICE)?ALICE is available on Binance, Mandala Exchange, Huobi Global and KuCoin.</td>

Numerous innovative gaming finance concepts have evolved from this model; for instance, scholarships have garnered significant attention.In the meantime, the prospects of blockchain games are immense since the whole blockchain-based in-game economy is still in its infancy and just beginning to develop its potential.There is no dedicated launchpad for blockchain games that allows those interested to gain early access to qualifying games.There is no game hub to explore standout blockchain game projects or valuable in-game items.There is no central repository where players can easily track their earnings and manage their in-game items.There is no platform that provides comprehensive game finance tools, including trading, funding, and scholarship opportunities.There is no model that enables owners of game items to maximize the value of their possessions when they are not actively playing the game.Besides, concerning game studios willing to adopt blockchain, many lack the necessary technical expertise and an effective platform for reaching out to game players or token holders.That’s why GameFi was created to work out these existing challenges.What is GameFi?GameFi is an all-encompassing hub and one-stop shop for game finance, serving game studios, players, traders, and investors. GameFi will bring the gaming community the promising blockchain game initiatives developed on the BSC and Polygon networks, which host most of the top-rated play-to-earn titles. Simultaneously, GameFi is the first marketplace to enable cross-games trading of in-game items and NFTs.GameFi is strongly backed by Icetea Labs, an incubation for rising projects such as Faraland and Kaby Arena, and DAO Maker, a launchpad for numerous high-profile game projects. This collaboration is a crucial first step providing a solid foundation for the growth of GameFi's ecosystem.GameFi EcosystemThe ecosystem of GameFi includes 5 pillars: Launchpad, Accelerator, Aggregator, Marketplace, and Yield Guilds, Launchpad. Each part has its own core features, innovations, and improvements that are solid pillars for the ecosystem to grow and benefit the user community.Game Aggregator is an ultimate gaming destination that allows gamers to discover and experience trending blockchain games. It also serves as a repository for players' in-game items and NFT assets, as well as a platform to track their play-to-earn yields. It then enables players to list their in-game items and NFTs for sale, exchange, rent, and more on GameFi Marketplace, regardless of the game they're playing.GameFi Yield Guilds enables users to earn passive income by participating in various gaming finance vaults. With GameFi’s Earning-without-Playing features, users can gain early access to high-profile game projects' tokens or game items, lend their game items to other players to earn, stake their tokens on other players' game items to earn, join yield guilds to earn passively, and so on. GameFi Launchpad is a game-dedicated launchpad that will be the first launchpad that conducts Initial Game Offerings (IGO) for game projects to get first access to game assets and engage with the gamers in the GameFi community. GameFi Marketplace will evolve into a one-stop shop for all in-game items and assets following the integration of DeFi tools. Discovering, purchasing, selling, trading, or even hosting an NFT auction has never been easier. Sellers and buyers can even carry cross-game NFT transactions via an exclusive exchange mechanism. All of this is done via smart contracts to ensure accuracy and reliability.GameFi Accelerator for blockchain games provides pre-built templates and tools to assist traditional game studios in implementing blockchain components and facilitating play-to-earn gameplay mechanisms. Go-to-market strategy The first part of the GameFi ecosystem to be released is GameFi Launchpad. This is a game-dedicated launchpad released for conducting the first IGO (Initial Game Offering), starting with Kaby Arena and DeathRoad. Most importantly, GameFi collaborates closely with Icetea Labs, DAO Maker, Animoca Brands, and other reputable partners to grow and diversify the GameFi game community, which includes a large network of game projects. additionally contributes to the growth of IGO activities, in-game item marketplaces, and production guilds.The project also has a strong team of KOLs, ambassadors, and influencers not only in the blockchain community but also in the gaming community with the mission of bringing GameFi closer to everyone, especially the gaming enthusiasts.Token economyStaking: Stake GAFI to get GameFi’s tiers and join IGO on GameFi’s launchpad.Discounts: GAFI holders receive discounts on trading and yield fees.Liquidity support: Portions of ecosystem fees are used to support the token’s liquidity on the secondary market.Governance: GAFI stakers have the ability to propose the direction of the ecosystem.Ecosystem Fees: Including trading fees on the marketplace, acceleration fees for Launchpad & Accelerator, and yield fees for the earn from the Play to Earn financed through the Yield Guild.</td>

Built using Substrate Framework, it provides high scalability, enabling almost instant low-cost transactions, and supports Solidity and EVM, allowing developers to seamlessly migrate their DApps from Ethereum without any change in the codebase. Reef Chain is the most advanced EVM-compatible blockchain. It's self-upgradable and has on-chain governance. Its infrastructure also allows for EVM extensions which allows for native token bridge, scheduled calls (ie. recurring payments), and smart contract in-place code upgrades. In the near future, it will support additional VMs which will allow developers to write code in multiple programming languages. The network runs on a Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism, which offers scalability and low fees.REEF is the native token that is used for:Fees for processing transactions and storing data.Running validator nodes by staking REEF tokens.Nominating which validator nodes should be part of the network.Reef is backed by multiple leading funds and venture capitalists including NGC, QCP, Bitcoin.com, Kenetic Capital, LD Capital, TRG Capital, Krypital Group, Genesis Block, Woodstock Fund and others.

At present, REEF has a circulating supply of 14,807,552,172
tokens while 38.2% of the Reef Chain supply is staked. Reef Chain today has over 23 validators. The current inflation of the supply is 8.3%Who Are the Founders of Reef?Reef was founded by Denko Mancheski. His motivation was to build the most advanced blockchain for retail investors who want to get involved with DeFi, NFTs and Gaming.Mancheski wanted to help cryptocurrency newcomers overcome the complexities associated with interacting with a blockchain and understanding new concepts such as DeFi and NFTs. Additionally, the ability to give access many bridges to other blockchains so that funds and liquidity can easily be ported to Reef Chain, allowing retail investors to take advantage of high scalability and low fees.Born in Macedonia, Mancheski said that his passion for FinTech led to him being introduced to blockchain technology. He has described forming a competent team as the biggest challenge associated with bringing Reef to life.When asked about the personal attributes that will help him become a successful entrepreneur, he added: “I have a very addictive personality — I just can’t stop doing something until I get to the goal that I set for myself.”Where Can I Buy Reef (REEF)?Binance offers the largest number of pairs as of September 2020 offering trading against USDT, BTC, and BUSD, while Huobi Global also offers Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Tether (USDT) options.

The team has tackled the high gas fees seen on the Ethereum blockchain by building on Substrate, which enable almost instant transactions and low costs, where some claim Ethereum’s fees renders DeFi protocols “unusable.”What makes the Reef chain unique is that any DeFi protocol that has already deployed on Ethereum or an EVM-compatible network can run on Reef with just a few changes to the code. Since Reef Chain straddles this intersection between Ethereum and Polkadot, along with bridges to other blockchains, the Reef ecosystem can be accessed by anyone with a Web3 wallet that is interested in accessing dApps on Reef.Because of how it has been built on Substrate, Reef is extensible and can have support for multiple VMs (Virtual Machines) as well as extension for existing popular VMs such as EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). It has on-chain upgrades functionality so any new features are easily pushed through the networking layer, but also on-chain governance.How Is the Reef Chain Network Secured?Reef uses a Nominated Proof of Stake system to bond to potential validators, nominate potential validators, and to secure the Reef network. This allows for low cost, almost instant transactions with finality achieved in 10 seconds on average.For those without the technical skills to run a Validator node, they can be a Nominator. Nominators secure the Reef Relay Chain by selecting good validators and staking REEF.Being a Validator requires technical expertise, staking REEF, and running a node 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year with high availability. Validators that cannot maintain performance or up time have their stakes slashed, as do their Nominators.While REEF are staked by nominating a Validator, they are ‘locked’ (bonded). Nominators can receive new REEF in their wallet, but cannot stake as a Validator or transfer REEF away from their wallet. Nominators can un-nominate at any time to stop staking their funds, which becomes effective in the next era. Un-nominating does not automatically unbond funds. There is an unbonding period of 28 days on Reef before bonded funds can be transferred after issuing an unbond transaction.Related Pages:New to cryptocurrency?

            <td>GoMining is a company whose mission is to make mining simple and accessible to everyone. We have been in the industry since 2017. There are two key products. GoMining token. It is the company’s utility token that •accepted as a means of payment when buying NFTs;
•makes it possible to pay for NFT maintenance and receive discounts;
•can be used to pay for game mechanics;
•accepted as a means of payment for goods in online stores;
•can be used as a means to earn royalties. GoMining token holders can use the staking function and receive rewards for doing so. GoMining Token is issued using smart contracts on the Ethereum (ETH) and Binance SmartChain (BSC) blockchain platforms.The initial issue was 100,000,000 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, and our primary objective is to bring the number of tokens in circulation up to 10,000,000,000 GoMining.Our second product is a unique NFT.These are images of digital miners that differ from each other in power, energy efficiency, and a large number of external attributes that owners can choose before buying.The most important advantage of these NFTs is that each is backed by the real computing power of our device fleet.As with real miners, our crypto works of art mine bitcoins. This is the first example of a non-fungible token with such capabilities.All of NFT by GoMining are issued on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-721 standard.There are 9 kinds of NFT power – XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL, 4XL, and digital miners from the Khabib collection have a capacity of 29 TH/s. Another important characteristic is energy efficiency. At the moment, our collections include 50W/TH, 35W/TH, and 25 W/TH digital miners.All of our NFTs mine bitcoins, but there are two ways to receive payments. It all depends on which game mode owners choose:1.Solo mining: Hold NFTs and get rewards in BTC every day in return; 
2. Pool mining: Play the game with a pool and receive rewards in BTC for winning the game.Holders themselves can decide how they mine bitcoins, and can change this decision anytime.Supply capacity for 1 NFT is growing steadily, causing an increase in holders' incomes.Mining with NFT by GoMining can be much more profitable than traditional ventures.There are 3 reasons for this:
1. The best electricity price you can imagine
5-7 cents for 1 kw/h. No one will offer better;
2. GoMining’s first-class service 
By purchasing NFT, you don't need to maintain your fleet of devices yourself. 
Our service centers fixes problems faster and cheaper than any contractor in the field;
3. Attractive discount system
GoMining provides NFT holders with additional discounts on electricity and maintenance, which can reach 14% in total.GoMining tokens and NFTs are a quick and simple way to mine BTC.</td>

            <td>To find out even more about this project, check out our deep dive of UFO Gaming.What Is UFO Gaming (UFO)?UFO Gaming is a decentralized gaming platform with play-to-earn elements, NFTs, and DeFi functionality like staking. Its first game is Super Galactic, an RPG/arcade action game with its own NFT collection combined with an auto battler. UFO Gaming is built on Ethereum, but its games are integrated with Immutable X, a layer-two scaling solution for NFT projects on Ethereum. Players can participate in UFO Gaming by minting playable characters in the form of NFTs called UFOeps. This is done by farming the in-game utility points called Plasma Points with the native UFO token. With UFOeps, players battle against a hostile alien race in a scavenged world to defend world peace and tranquility while earning rewards for completing daily quests. UFOeps can also be leveled up and later sold on the UFO Gaming marketplace. After completing its launch phase in Q3 2021, UFO Gaming is currently in its growth phase and listing on different exchanges and launching partnerships. In the future, the developers plan an expansion phase that will see the launch of its marketplace, breeding between different NFTs, the introduction of virtual land, and the release of its first game Super Galactic. This will be followed by the launch of a metaverse, a partnership reveal with a game studio, new games, and a DEX integrated with the platform.Who Are the Founders of UFO Gaming?The founders of UFO Gaming are unknown; however, they claim to have produced a range of games over the past six years in the game development sphere. The team is also supposedly experienced in crypto, with most of them being in the space since 2014. The focus is on a long-term driven approach that concentrates on UFO Gaming being built at the frontier of blockchain gaming. UFO Gaming has sealed several high-impact partnerships with projects such as Kadena, Merit Circle, Citizen X, Polygon, and ShibaSwap. What Makes UFO Gaming Unique?Despite its superficial similarities with other play-to-earn games, UFO Gaming tries to set itself apart by an intricate in-game economy that combines NFT minting and GameFi quests. In the so-called Cosmos Event, players get to mint Origin UFOeps, which are the rarest and most valuable NFTs in the ecosystem. Over time, the probability to mint an Origin UFOep decreases. Origin UFOeps can only be bought with Plasma Points, equivalent to experience points, and generated through the Super Galactic staking dApp. Plasma points are also required to access the game. Players can attain Plasma Points by staking their UFO in a single-staking UFO vault or a UFO-ETH liquidity pool. The $UFO single-stake pool holds 25% of the pool, while the UFO-ETH LP pool holds 75% of the total pool.UFOeps are central to playing Super Galactic, the RPG/arcade action/ARG game, where you can battle and breed digital super soldiers. Each UFOeps has a uniquely generated power force known as Spirit Force. If a player did not manage to mint an UFOeps, they can buy one with UAP, the game’s third token used for merging NFTs. UAP can also be earned for completing missions and daily quests, with a rating system rewarding players for their daily interactions. Lastly, UFOeps follow a detailed rating system with several classes distinguishing between higher-ranked and lower-ranked soldiers. New soldiers can be bred by fusing two old ones and completing daily quests can improve a soldier’s ranking. Related Pages:Check out Ultra (UOS) — a gaming ecosystem and launchpad.

UFO Gaming uses a three-token ecosystem:UFO is used to connect the different tokens and can be staked in the single-staking pools or UFO/ETH liquidity pools to mint NFTs.Plasma Points can be earned from staking and are used to buy soldiers (UFOeps).UAP is needed to breed soldiers and complete daily quests and missions. In contrast to Plasma Points, UAP can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies like UFO.All UFO has been launched without pre-mines or pre-sales and is 100% community-owned. 50% was added to the Uniswap liquidity pool and 50% was burned on TGE. The total supply of UFO is 51.5 trillion. How Is the UFO Gaming Network Secured?UFO Gaming is built on Immutable X, a layer-two scaling solution for NFTs on Ethereum. Immutable X uses Zk-rollups to achieve a much higher transaction speed than Ethereum (9,000 tps) at zero gas fees while not compromising security. In doing so, it aims to become the go-to blockchain for NFT-based games.  UFO is a ERC-20 token on Ethereum. Where Can You Buy UFO Gaming (UFO)?UFO is available on KuCoin, Gate.io, Uniswap (V2), LBank and MEXC.</td>

            <td>Star Atlas is a massive multiplayer online game that takes place in a virtual gaming metaverse. It is being built on Unreal Engine 5, allowing the game to feature cinema-quality, real-time environments. Star Atlas takes place in a futuristic science fiction setting in 2620, where three major factions have emerged and are competing for resources and control: MUD - humankind, ONI - a consortium of alien races and Ustur - sentient androids.The game combines different genres. It is part strategy in that you have to develop tactical plans of action on how to interact with other players and factions. Part of it is exploration, as the game features an abundance of stars for exploration and exploitation. Since players can travel to and explore these stars independently through first-person flight, it is in part a flight simulation. Lastly, players can mine resources and derive revenue streams from doing so, making it also a role-playing game.After choosing a faction, players initially start in faction security zones without combat to explore basic gameplay. Later, they can venture out to medium-tier security and open gameplay where combat is possible.Fundamental gameplay pillars are:
* Deep space exploration;
* Combat;
*  Building space stations and ships;
* Choosing in-game professions to mine resources;
* Forging alliances to scale control of resources.Assets acquired in the game can later be exchanged for real-world currency.</td>

            <td>What Is DeFi Kingdoms?DeFi Kingdoms is a browser-based blockchain game combining several DeFi elements in an intriguing and compelling way. Its gameplay elements merge together a DEX, an NFT marketplace, and liquidity pool opportunities all under an umbrella of fantasy pixel art, giving the game its trademark combination of DeFi and retro game design. In this fashion, the team behind DeFi Kingdoms wants to “embrace the full potential of the blockchain in game form” and create synergies between gaming and decentralized finance.Originally launched on Harmony in August 2021, in March 2022, DeFi Kingdoms launched its Crystalvale realm on  DFK Chain, an Avalanche Subnet, and in December 2022 migrated the Serendale realm to the Klaytn blockchain.What Makes DeFi Kingdoms Unique?First and foremost, DeFi Kingdoms stands out thanks to the clever integration of DeFi functionality with game elements. In contrast to countless other games incorporating similar features, the combination of financialization and gaming feels natural on DeFi Kingdoms. This is aided by the several key features of DeFi Kingdoms.Its decentralized exchange uses the Uniswap V2 Protocol and allows players to swap tokens and become a liquidity provider to earn fees on token swaps.LP tokens can also be staked in The Gardens, where players can receive tokens for buying rare NFTs and other items. The Gardens are visualized in a unique way through different plants and crops the players have to tend to and harvest to receive their rewards. Each garden is a unique LP pairing and harvested yield is deposited in the storehouse.Heroes in DeFi Kingdoms are more than standard NFTs, as they are playable characters that can earn token rewards and level up their stats. Being one of the game's key features, they are assigned to go on quests and battle in different gameplay modes, including the DFK Duel minigame. Heroes are bought and sold in The Tavern and new heroes can be summoned at the Portal by combining genes from existing Heroes to create an entirely new, potentially extremely rare, NFT. Furthermore, players will be able to equip their Heroes with Pets and various Equipment NFTs, enabling them to have special passive and active abilities. Quests that Heroes can go on allow them to gather in-game resources, increase their farming yields from the Gardens, and unlock those rewards early with the help of Mining Heroes.Players can also buy Land Plots in DeFi Kingdoms. These plots will differ based on their location, in turn providing different quantities of resources. In the future, players will have the option to build on their lands to increase bonuses for Heroes. Owning land will also enable players to find new valuable resources that can be used in Crafting and other game modes.How Many DeFi Kingdoms (JEWEL) Tokens Are There in Circulation?With changes to the DeFi Kingdoms tokenomics in December 2022, JEWEL is now an ecosystem and utility token that is used across realms. In addition to being the native gas token on DFK Chain, JEWEL is used for liquidity pooling, staking for governance rights, fee distribution opportunities, and in-game Power-Ups.When DeFi Kingdoms: Serendale relaunched on Klaytn, it also changed the tokenomics of the JEWEL token, reducing its maximum supply from 500 million tokens to 125 million tokens, all of which have been minted. With token burns from in-game activities and use of gas on DFK Chain, the total supply will continue to be reduced, making JEWEL a deflationary token.The circulating supply of JEWEL is further reduced by players who voluntarily lock JEWEL in exchange for governance tokens following Curve's veToken model.Who Are the Developers of DeFi Kingdoms?DeFi Kingdoms is maintained and developed by Kingdom Studios. Members of the team operate under pseudonyms, a common feature in community-driven projects as the examples of SushiSwap and LooksRare show. Nevertheless, the team hosts weekly AMAs in Discord and on YouTube, and many team members have voluntarily doxxed on live-stream.The Kingdom Studios Board of Directors consists of:
Dreamer, President and Director of Revenue and OperationsFrisky Fox, Co-Founder and Director of BlockchainBeetle Dude, Director of ApplicationOther pillar heads include:
Pie Face, Co-Founder and Director of DigitalBolon Soron, Director of Player EngagementThe team has outlined several trust-building measures, including verifying smart contracts on chain, seeking out audits, and the exclusive use of multi-signature wallets and vesting on JEWEL tokens.Where Can You Buy DeFi Kingdoms (JEWEL)?JEWEL is primarily available through DeFi Kingdoms' decentralized exchanges on DFK Chain and Klaytn. It can also be purchased on MEXC, BigONE, Hotbit, and CoinEx.If you want to learn more about how to start buying cryptocurrencies, you can read more in our guide.Related Pages:Check out The Sandbox (SAND) — an open-world blockchain game inspired by Minecraft.Check out MyNeighborAlice (ALICE) — a farming-themed blockchain game.Read our list of the top play-to-earn games.Get the latest crypto news and latest trading insights with the CoinMarketCap blog.</td>

            <td>What Is Step App (FITFI)?Step App (FITFI) is a project based on the Step protocol for FitFi (Fitness Finance) where users and their metaverse avatars complete fitness quests and PvP (player versus player) challenges. Fitness Finance is a market economy model similar to GameFi, in fact, the governance token, FITFI, was named after it. Thanks to FitFi, members consume fitness content and earn income by immersing themselves in the fitness industry.The app's augmented reality technology bridges the gamified metaverse with the real world, turning fitness into a social experience where mechanics allow people to compete and win. By downloading Step App, users can earn by walking, running, competing with friends/app users, chatting, exploring the metaverse or the real world. Step App creates a fitness experience in the metaverse due to geo-location technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).The Step App economy is based on gaming perks and values ​​and includes staking, liquidity rewards, locks, buybacks and burns. The ecosystem uses two tokens: FITFI is the governance token, which is fueled by ecosystem fees, and KCAL is the in-game token, which is used to buy SNEAK (NFTs) and generates the value of the game economy, allowing users to mine, earn, stake.The project was created in Q4 2021 and consists of products such as Fitness Metaverse, NFT Market and Limited Drops. The Step App functionality is designed to attract and connect users, inspiring them to engage in daily physical activity and regular exercise.Who Are the Founders of Step App?Dharpan Randhawa is the company's president with 20 years of experience in the sports and entertainment industry as a marketer and commercial leader.

            <td>What Is Exeedme (XED)?Exeedme is a blockchain-powered tournament platform that allows gamers of all skill levels to monetize their skills. The platform’s vision is to build a fair and trusted play-to-earn platform where gamers can play their favorite games, challenge opponents and profit from betting on their own victory. Gamers can earn money from their bets, earn XED for engagement, and exclusive NFT prizes for winning tournaments and events. The platform offers a matchmaking mechanism where players can challenge friends or play against players of similar skill levels for stakes. In doing so, they earn XED, which is required to level up and unlock higher leagues with higher stakes. The platform is game-agnostic, meaning it acts as a single point of access to engage with different games such as CS:GO, LOL, as well as decentralized games like Skyweaver. The team released the first Beta version this year and acquired a UK Gambling Operating License. Currently available on Ethereum, BSC and Polygon, it plans to launch on Polkadot in the future and launch a V1.0 of its XED decentralized exchange. Who Are the Founders of Exeedme?The Exeedme team brands itself as a “seasoned team with entrepreneurial experience and make it happen attitude.” The project was launched by CEO Nuno Fernandes and CSO Francisco Varela. Nuno Fernandes is an experienced dealmaker with €1B+ closings and a former manager of the mergers and acquisitions teams of PwC and KPMG. Francisco Varela is a serial entrepreneur with five successful ventures launched and scaled to $10m+ and the first exclusive gaming gear marketplace founder. The team is complemented by advisors Guilherme Almedia (tech development), Rui Teixeira (blockchain gaming), and Nuno Correia (blockchain payments). Ricardo Pacheco, a professional Counter-Strike:GO player, is the project’s ambassador. What Makes Exeedme Unique?The Exeedme team realized that making money playing video games is very hard except for a selected few professionals. However, becoming a professional requires a lot of time to build up the skill and comes with huge competition and high barriers to entry. Moreover, traditional games are characterized by aggressive in-game purchasing strategies and siloed game assets that don’t allow players to monetize their in-game assets. Exeedme expands beyond the commonly known free-to-play and play-to-win gaming models and allows players of any level to monetize their skills.Players choose their game and the stake and let the game do the matchmaking. The platform features several gaming modes: solo, party, teams, and pro seasons. Players can also join skill-filtered leagues and earn participation rewards in the native XED token. XED and NFT rewards depend on the amount of XED staked on the platform. The more XED a player has staked, the lower their match fees and the more access they receive to special tournaments, exclusive NFTs, and in-platform badges and skins.

The token distribution is as follows:Foundational Reserve - 10% one-year lock, then 25% quarterly.Seed Sale - 10% vested over eight months.Pre-public Sale - 30% over three months 25% monthly.Ecosystem - 20% vested over eight months.Team - 10% one-year lock, then 25% quarterly.Ecosystem - 20% vested over eight months.Liquidity Fund - 20% vested over eight months.XED launched with a pre-public price of $0.03 and a Uniswap listing price of $0.05. Token holders can vote on the platform’s governance and propose new games to be added. Organizers are able to build their own community and start organizing tournaments past a certain stalking threshold. On the XED DEX, gamers will be able to swap, buy, and sell fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens.How Is the Exeedme Network Secured?XED an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC. Currently, the platform is a fully working Ethereum-based minimum viable product. In the future, Exeedme plans to be available on several blockchains using Polkadot.ERC-20 is a token standard most new tokens follow when publishing on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchains and the go-to solution for many decentralized applications and exchanges to launch on. It is secured by a proof-of-work consensus mechanism that requires miners to mine new Ether. A set of decentralized nodes validates transactions and secures the Ethereum blockchain.Can Exeedme Hit $1?Exeedme hit an all-time high of almost $2 in March, up from an initial launch price of $0.05. That indicates there is strong interest in the platform’s value proposition. However, it has since retraced to below $0.50. Whether the token will hit $1 again and possibly eclipse its previous high will depend on the implementation of new features and the acquisition of new users.

            <td>What Are Xaya and CHI?Xaya is a language and blockchain agnostic platform for creating fully decentralized, permissionless, trustless, and serverless games and dapps. CHI is the native currency of the Xaya blockchain. Xaya solves scalability issues for blockchains for both performance and computational complexity for games/dapps. Xaya is a custom blockchain code-forked from Bitcoin and Namecoin. It uses the blockchain as a base data store similar to as is done in Namecoin. Using this base data, it ensures cryptographic security for games/dapps. Xaya’s Game Channel technology enables numerous computationally highly complex, real-time Massively Multiplayer Online games (MMOs) and dapps. How Does Xaya (CHI) Work? Xaya uses the blockchain as a base data store for cryptographic security but decouples state computation away from the blockchain using Game State Processors (GSPs). GSPs are similar to smart contracts on Ethereum. However, since computation is decoupled, they can be arbitrarily complex.GSPs that implement Xaya Game Channels can provide real-time trustless gameplay without bloating the core blockchain. An unlimited number of channels can run in parallel and each channel can have an unlimited amount of moves (transactions) between them without costing any fees, except those for opening and closing the channel. Due to Xaya’s blockchain agnostic approach, GSPs can be developed and run on other platforms such as Ethereum, side chains, and others, and make use of their consensus mechanisms as well. Wrapped CHI can be used as the currency in those games.Can You Mine CHI?CHI can be mined using SHA-256d or a Neoscrypt variant with 25% of block rewards going to SHA-256d miners and 75% of block rewards going to Neoscrypt miners. This provides a balance of high security through SHA-256d and broad distribution through Neoscrypt. Xaya SHA-256d is merge mined with Bitcoin (or any other SHA-256d coin) and has a significant percentage of Bitcoin’s hashing power. Xaya’s Neoscrypt is mined with GPUs either solo or in pools. What Is a CHI Burn?Burning coins is when they are sent to a provably unspendable output. An example of this is in Xaya’s Taurion game where the in-game currency (cubits) can only be purchased through burning CHI.Who Are the Founders of Xaya?The Xaya founders are Andrew Colosimo, Daniel Kraft, Konstantin Gorskov, Sebastian de Gruiter, and Ryan Smyth. Colosimo was a major contributor to Namecoin development in 2013. He is also the creator of the world’s first blockchain game, Huntercoin.Kraft is a mathematician and former engineer at Google. He is the primary blockchain developer for Namecoin and Xaya. He also regularly contributes to the Bitcoin Core code on GitHub. What Makes Xaya Unique? Scalability is a main concern for most blockchain systems.  This is amplified if complex computations and storage are required, e.g. when building complicated on-chain logic in smart-contract systems like Ethereum.To solve scalability, Xaya implements a two-thronged approach:  The basic design with game-state processors separated from the core blockchain allows to "shard off" computations for individual applications from the core network, similar to how rollups work on Ethereum (except by design much simpler and cleaner).For even greater boosts in scalability and reducing the cost of data availability on chain, Xaya also implements Game Channels, a peer reviewed technology that allows for unlimited transactions per second while reducing blockchain bloat.Xaya is unique in that it enables fully decentralized, trustless, permissionless, and serverless games/daps in a programming language and blockchain agnostic manner. Assets on other blockchains can easily be incorporated into a Xaya GSP. The Xaya team pioneered the world’s first blockchain game in 2013, Huntercoin, and have extended the concept into a full platform where games take on true blockchain characteristics:DecentralizedPermissionlessTrustlessServerlessTransparentIrreversible and immutableSecureAnonymous/pseudo-anonymousLimited and scarceProvably fairFraud-proof and uncheatableHow Is the Xaya CHI Network Secured?Xaya uses a triple-purpose mining technique that uses merge mined SHA-256d and a variant of Neoscrypt with 25% of block rewards going to SHA-256d miners and 75% of block rewards going to Xaya Neoscrypt miners.Merged mining SHA-256d allows Bitcoin (and other SHA-256d miners) to mine CHI essentially for free. The massive hashing work done there makes CHI highly secure.  If an attacker were to obtain 100% of the Neoscrypt hashing power, he would still not be able to out-do the work performed by SHA-256d miners. Stand-alone mining with Neoscrypt facilitates broader distribution of CHI coins to the community. Xaya’s dual algorithm mining increases its resilience against stalling.</td>

Myria's scaling solution, built in partnership with StarkWare, offers instant trade confirmation, 0 gas fee when minting and trading NFTs without compromising the security of users' assets. Myria's L2, developed using StarkWare's STARK prover, utilizes Zero-Knowledge Rollup (ZK-Rollup) technology to bundle large numbers of transfers into a single transaction to facilitate up to 9,000 transactions per section (TPS).Myria is developing Myria L2, a non-custodial Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution as well as a full suite of auxiliary blockchain tooling to empower tokenization efforts across a wide range of verticals.Myria L2 utilizes Starkware’s prover and rollup zero-knowledge technology to aggregate thousands of layer 2 transactions into single Ethereum transactions. The results are
dramatically increased throughput and lower transaction costs which are prerequisites for
seamless token experiences.By building an Ethereum-anchored L2 rather than a loosely-coupled or even entirely
independent sidechain, Myria is able to comfortably meet the performance requirements
of some of the most demanding use cases on the market without sacrificing the desire of
end-users to continue leveraging Ethereum’s battle-tested consensus protocol. The
oft-mentioned tradeoff between genuine usability and fully decentralized security is a
false one - Myria L2 offers both.That harmony between scalability and security is moot, however, if developers are unable
to leverage it. To that effect, Myria’s suite of developer tools, a diverse array of Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs), Software Development Kits (SDKs), and a Domain Specific
Language (DSL), aims to abstract away the complexity of writing and interacting with
zero-knowledge compatible smart contracts without curtailing creator ingenuity.Simply put, this means any transaction, from minting an NFT or launching a new
collection to transferring or exchanging existing tokens requires no direct smart contract
or network knowledge on the part of the developer. Any developer who is able to connect
to a REST API, knows how to produce, manage, and interact with tokenization projects on
Myria L2.Central to the goal of accomplishing the above without restricting use-case flexibility, as
stated, will be Myria’s tokenization rules engine and Domain Specific Language (DSL).
Existing smart contract development tools box developers in by making key decisions
about the nature of the contracts they deploy on behalf of the creators themselves. Myria’s
rules engine and DSL will grant developers the ability to customize low-level aspects of
their assets without complicating the process for more novice users.Myria Platform
Myria believes, at a macro level, that there exist today two key impediments to the
industry’s shared objective of enabling more people to reap the myriad benefits of
blockchain technology. Those are: 1) the aforementioned tradeoff between security and
scalability and 2) the immense technical learning curve for development teams unfamiliar
with existing blockchain stacks.
To mitigate the impact of these barriers, we are creating an all-in-one blockchain platform
including Myria L2 wallet, NFT marketplace, to enable third party gaming studios, NFT
communities, and developers to easily develop blockchain-powered games, DApps, and
experiences.
By providing B2B technology solutions, along with our developer grant program, Myria’s
Partner division aims to enable third-party developers to onboard onto the blockchain
and join the next frontier of the virtual economy.Myria Studios

The right mix of nostalgia and technology, it was launched right into the NFT craze of Q1 2021. Each Polychain Monsters digital monster is a collectible artifact with unique properties and rarity. PMON is a native ETH-20 token of the Polychain Monsters platform, necessary if one wants to purchase new Polychain Monsters or to unlock new features.To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Polychain Monsters.Polychain Monsters was founded in early March 2021 and it soon secured a $740,000 funding round from six strategic investors, led by Moonrock Capital and Morningstar Ventures. An IDO (initial dex offering) event at Polkastarted on Mar. 31, 2021 has helped the founders raise approximately $100,000. Two weeks after launch, it has successfully placed itself among the top ten most used ETH tokens, burning millions only on gas fees.Who Are the Founders of Polychain Monsters?Polychain Monsters was founded by three software professionals from Bremen, Germany. Their names are Leif Eric Leiser, Lennart Brandt and Finn Hansen.Leif Eric Leiser is the team’s CEO and software engineer. In parallel with Polychain Monsters as of April 2021, he worked as software engineer at a DeFi platform Tixl.Finance and is running eco-shop chain Beleaf as co-founder and software engineer. However, before that, he has had a dozen short contract jobs and internships in software engineering and product development, including such companies as Philips, Lufthansa and Elbstack. He holds a master’s degree in industrial engineering from Hamburg University of Technology, which he finished in 2018. Lennart Brandt is Polychain Monsters chief marketing officer (CMO) and software developer. He is also known as the founder of JoinWeBurn.com, a relatively popular fitness app. Like Leiser, he worked on Tixl.Finance in the position of a UX designer and up to founding Polychain Monsters has also worked at Elbstack, a German software company, as a serial entrepreneur for various projects, playing roles of product designer and react native developer as well. He has a bachelor’s in business informatics (BI) from IBS IT & Business School OldenburgFinn Hansen is the third partner, who serves Polychain Monsters as a full-stack software engineer.

When the infamous CryptoKitties broke out, the technology was not yet fully ready to embrace such a game, but four years since it is different: the infrastructure has significantly improved and was ready for the next wave of growth. The mechanics of Polychain Monsters trading is rather simple: there are collectible NFT Polychain Monsters, there are “Booster Packs'' to distribute new animated monsters, where you do not know which ones you’ll get from the pack (just like in the 90s, yes), and finally there are PMON tokens to buy and trade them with.Moreover, initially Polychain Monsters in the Booster Packs are not yet full-fledged NFTs, they are what the developers call “soft-minted.” If a user decides to turn his Polychain Monsters of choice into an NFT, he has to burn PMON tokens to mint it. Given that the total volume of tokens will decrease with every minted Polychain Monsters NFT, their price is designed to rise.The project developers are planning to unveil a number of user features, including PMON staking, full utilization of level-2 meta-data properties and cross-chain support with the power of Polkadot, all to enrich the gaming experience.Related Pages:What’s the deal with NFTs?

Visit our educational portal CMC Alexandria..Never miss the hottest new crypto projects with our blog rich with the latest crypto news and insights.How Many Polkamon (PMON) Coins Are There in Circulation?The total token supply is capped at 10 million PMON with the initial circulation around 1.8 million. 37.15% of tokens are in hands of strategic investors with a 90 day vesting, 10% are in foundational reserve locked for 1 year, then unlocked with daily vesting over 365 days, 10% are team and advisory tokens locked for 1 year, then bound by daily vesting over 365 days. However, another 20% are marketing and business development tokens, 20% of which are available before listing, the rest bound by daily vesting over 365 days. 20% are liquidity tokens with the same vesting schedule. Finally, only as much as 2.85% PMON tokens are public.How Is the Polkamon Network Secured?PMON tokens are standard ERC-20 tokens, while the Polkamons can be minted as ERC-721, a non-fungible token, meaning that it runs on and is secured by the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum, in turn, is secured by its Ethash proof-of-work function.ERC-20 merely defines a set of rules for tokens, as well as security considerations mainly related to the strength of the Ethereum network. For example, congestion can hike the price of gas needed to perform transactions, leading to delays and abnormally high transaction fees, which impact all participants. This has already happened at the early days of Ethereum when in 2017 the first popular game based on smart contracts called CryptoKitties has completely clogged the network.Where Can You Buy Polkamon (PMON)?Let us not be confused with several types of assets constituting the Polkamon universe. Polkamon collectible NFTs are traded at peer-to-peer marketplaces such as OpenSea.PMON tokens are available for trade at many crypto exchanges, the largest ones including Uniswap (V2), 1Inch Exchange and Gate.io. You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page. Trading paris for PMON include stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and other cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum (ETH).

Eventually, the staking rewards of every user will be different based on the number of tokens staked and the performance of their stake-backed asset.(2): Stake Tethered NFTs:Any Actionable Assets (Characters, Spaceships, Game-Builder NFTs) on the Revolve Platform require an underlying stake of RPG (Revolve Games' Native Token). This means that should any user decide to unstake his tokens, the NFT tied to that token will be returned to the NFT pool. The same logic would apply to any transfers of NFTs: Any transfer of NFTs would result in the underlying staking contract to move to the new owner of the NFT.Revolve Metaverse:These two ideas will be delivered via the medium of the Revolve Metaverse - an inter-galactic world where users are able to own or rent land on planets, building games and monuments on top of users' land. Characters and spacecraft will generate additional reward multipliers through prolonged play and completion of different events that occur on the Revolve Metaverse, while the popularity of user-built games (via the game-builder packs) will also generate additional yield for landowners.Revolve Games aims to be one of the leading platforms providing Play-to-Earn opportunities with ample content for any audience.</td>

Multi-chain access - farm $ZOO tokens and trade ZooNFTs on several networks (currently available on Avalanche and Wanchain, but more to come);Access to an NFT Marketplace - trade ZooGames NFTs and more on OpenZoo;Multi-chain gaming - connect to ZooGames from any available chain and play fun games.How Many ZooKeeper (ZOO) Coins Are There in Circulation?Since ZooKeeper employs a dynamic market cap strategy, the total supply of ZOO is flexible. ZOO tokens are being mined at a rate of 10 ZOO per block without pre-mining or presales of the token. The exact market cap figure depends on the boost percentage from NFTs, as well as the lockup periods by users staking ZOO. Therefore, the minimum total amount of ZOO will be 155 million and the maximum amount 393 million, which will only be known after all ZOO have been mined.The token allocation is as follows:77% are reserved for farming9% are kept for the foundation8% go to marketing3% go to advisors3% will be used to purchase wanTokens chosen by the communityNote: These are the Tokenomics of the ZOO Token on the Wanchain Network.How Is the ZooKeeper Network Secured?ZooKeeper is built on Wanchain, itself a fork of Ethereum.

            <td>To find out even more about this project, check out our deep dive of Kaby Arena.What Is Kaby Arena (KABY)?Kaby Arena (KABY) is a Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token that links to the Kaby gaming ecosystem. It is developed by Ziga gaming studio, which has produced eight revenue-generating games with over a million active monthly players. \
 \
Kaby Arena makes use of free-to-play and play-to-earn (P2E) mechanisms to create money-earning opportunities for platform users. The game, a tactical multiplayer role playing game (RPG), allows players to collect materials in the game that can then be minted into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using KABY tokens. \
 \
The nature of the games also has close ties to the cryptocurrency world, with game rules designed around understanding the crypto market. Those who understand it have higher chances of winning points in the game. This helps to incentivise players to learn the crypto market better in order to win more coins. \
 \
In the game, each player has no limits to the number of heroes and equipment it can gather, selecting from a total of five heroes (water, wind, fire, darkness, light) which each have four skills. Like most RPG games, every hero also has four basic stats: HP (health power), attack, defense and support. \
 \
As of present, Kaby Arena is at the first stage of its planned roadmap, having successfully completed the game and smart contract development. In the upcoming months, plans include public tokens sale for KABY coins as well as NFT heroes sale, and further down the road the launch of a marketplace for players to trade NFTs, along with a staking platform.By Oct. 2021, an MVP game will be launched and by November, NFT minting will be allowed. By Dec. 2021, player versus player (PvP) waging will be enabled.Who Are the Founders of Kaby Arena (KABY)?Kaby Arena was developed by Ziga gaming arena, which was established in 2014. Games by Ziga have seen a million monthly active users and 300,000 monthly. \
 \
The founders of Kaby Arena are Nhan Bui and Anh Phan. CEO Nhan Bui was a former IT lead at RMIT, and has ten years in virtual collectible trading. COO Anh Phan has a phD from Japan’s Nara Institute of Science and Technology, with five years of experience in AI and data science. Both founders come from competitive gaming backgrounds. The Kaby Arena team has a total of six members.What Makes Kaby Arena (KABY) Unique?Kaby Arena is unique in that it aims to solve the issues that plague regular NFT games — that of a low player base, a result of high cost required for a player to begin taking part in the tournaments. This high cost of introduction results in regular players unable to join and only seasoned gamers being able to break the cost barrier, which KABY aims to solve by minimising the high entry cost of the game, such as by making the game free to play and by introducing anti-scripting measures to disallow bots and remove such accounts.Several ways Kaby Arena uses to make its games more attractive include emphasising the competitiveness factor, firstly by using a matchmaking algorithm to ensure players get fair fights with those of similar levels and ultimately creating fair game play. Next, regular tournaments are held every week, month, quarter and year with attractive prizes to be won to incentivise gamers to stay active.  \
 \
Finally, Kaby Arena allows for the combination of powerful heroes to create a new offspring with inherited traits to counter overly powerful heroes, again ensuring fair game play.  \
 \
Beyond being linked to online games and letting players earn money through gaming, Kaby Arena also allows users to lease their assets, allowing users to generate income. Those who choose to rent NFTs can also surpass the barrier of high cost of owning their own NFTs. To smoothen the renting process, rentals can be done with or without collateral, benefitting free-to-play gamers and ensuring easier market entry. \
 \
The KABY token has multiple uses both in the game and outside. Within the game, it can be used to exchange for resources or gaming upgrades. The token can also be used to mint NFT, buy or rent NFT assets and also to be staked for interest for passive income. There are two types of heroes in the Kaby Arena world. Non-NFT heroes are a free reward from the player versus environment (PvE) mode of the game and can be converted to NFT heroes by utilising the KABY token. These NFT heroes are ERC-721 tokens and can be traded on the Kaby Arena marketplace or other NFT markets.A final unique point of the Kaby Arena is the earlier mentioned links to the cryptocurrency world, where Crypto Wars are held to benefit players with an understanding of how crypto works, and thus onboarding more people onto the crypto world and hence benefitting the entire crypto market as a whole. \
 \
Kaby Arena does not stop at just creating games — it allows community-wide participation through the usage of forums to engage users and ensure that everyone has a stake in future game developments, a strategy that promotes game loyalty.

With the perfect combination of fighting and strategy, this game becomes thrillingly immersive and is split up into separate three-minute games.Players can combine the cards in their own card library in different ways to ensure that their deck is as strong as possible. They can play either PVE or PVP by deploying and placing cards. Different cards have different effects, and whether we’re talking about Common or Legendary cards, players will be keen to collect them all. Players will be tasked not only to watch their own deck but also to carefully observe the movements and positioning of their opponents. This provides the player with an incentive to practice and develop their in-game skills over time while receiving fantastic brain training akin to that received by chess players. Only, this training is manifested in skilfully using heroes to ride thousands out to the battlefield.Of course, in addition to the game being fun, each one of the player’s cards has its own value. Players can obtain high-value cards by collecting, fighting, trading, summoning or synthesizing certain cards. This is also one of the biggest charms of GameFi when compared with traditional games. Era7 will continuously update the game’s content, adding new cards, playing methods and battle passes to meet the continuous needs of players while generating revenue across the board.

            <td>What Is Rune (RUNE)?
Rune is an open-ended dark fantasy gaming universe built on Binance Smart Chain, where players can battle, join a guild, collect powerful weapons, and earn NFTs and cryptocurrency in the form of runes by playing.Runes are small and rare stones inscribed with magical glyphs needed to craft Runewords (NFTs), weapons, and armor. 33 different Runes are distributed to players over two years. Each Rune has a supply of 100,000 or less, and players can earn Runes by competing against other players, joining guilds, participating in yield farms, and community participation.The Rune universe consists of Rune Evolution, a play-to-earn game, Rune Farm, the yield farm, Runewords (NFTs), and the Rune Infinite Arena, a player-versus-player game. The team is also developing the Rune Sanctuary, an MMORPG that will be launched in 2022. Currently, Rune is running on BSC, but the team sees the universe as blockchain-agnostic and is building a bridge to Polygon.Who Are the Founders of Rune?
Rune’s founders are anonymous. The team chose to stay anonymous to protect itself, its associates, and users from “archaic legislation imposed by governments who won’t understand the emerging DeFi field for years to come.” The team alludes to “Binzy,” which is their fill-in for the person(s) behind Rune, a real software engineer with 20 years of experience and connections in the crypto world.In total, the team consists of 12 people: the lead dev, four unity developers, a React developer, a Solidity developer, two consultant developers, two consultant project managers, one marketing manager, one community manager, four mods and some advisorsWhat Makes Rune Unique?
Rune offers an attractive mix of blockchain gaming, NFTs, and elements from decentralized finance. Its universe is split into four different parts.Rune Evolution is a play-to-earn game and was the first game built for the ecosystem. You start as a dragonling that can fly around and eat sprites to evolve into a dragon eventually. One round in the web browser-based game lasts five minutes, and players can earn crypto as a reward.Rune Farm is the yield farm that attracts liquidity to the ecosystem. You can acquire runes through providing liquidity and raiding farms, i.e., yield farming. The team promises that since the supply of runes is limited, their price should find a bottom. Moreover, each rune has its specific utility, and runes can also be combined to build Runewords. Furthermore, for 2022, an online RPG built around runes is in development.Runewords (NFTs) are unique weapons and armor. Each Runeword is suitable for a specific hero class (seven different hero classes exist) or style of play. Runewords improve a hero’s capabilities in battle and offer improved farming and merchant abilities. Runewords are shared, collected, and traded in the Rune Market and players will soon be able to lend them to others. Runewords are crafted from runes.Finally, the Rune Infinite Arena is a player-versus-player, web-based 2D topdown game, where you battle your opponents for prizes. Once you defeat an opponent, they go back to the beginning while you can continue the path that goes on infinitely. The last one standing after one minute of battle claims a reward in the form of crypto or NFTs. Every 15 minutes, you enter a new arena.</td>

It incorporates both play-to-earn and staking and prides itself on not requiring players to spend any money before they start playing. Set in both the Middle Ages and the future, the game revolves around the human desire to live forever, master the universe, and accumulate resources. In the first set of games, taking place in the Middle Ages, players can choose their own scenario. The gameplay includes building armies, devising strategies, and fighting battles, as each player takes on a role as a king of a country. The second set of games transpires in the future and, presumably, will incorporate VR and AR technology, as My Master War hints that players will not need laptops or mobile devices to play.Currently, My Master War is available as a browser game, but it is set to launch on Google Play and the App Store. The game’s evolution into a metaverse, together with UX and UI improvements, is planned for 2022. Who Are the Founders of My Master War?Behind the development of My Master War is a team of experienced Vietnamese developers, with Dominic and Henry Nguyen heading the project, as the CEO and CTO, respectively. Dominic Nguyen boasts seven years of experience as CEO and CTO, in addition to experience as a project manager in the Japanese market and with big data. Henry Nguyen is an experienced blockchain architect that previously worked on Krispay, a digital wallet, and Euphoreum, a crypto wallet. My Master War also has an impressive array of advisors and investors including Trung Nguyen, the CEO of the play-to-earn hit Axie Infinity, Henry Tran, the founder of HubGlobal, and Thanh Dao, the CEO of LaunchZone. Furthermore, the project has successfully raised $1.2 million from Animoca Brands, one of the investors behind The Sandbox. What Makes My Master War Unique?My Master War combines elements of NFT games with GameFi to create an immersive experience. In the medieval stage of the game, players choose generals, whom they need to win battles, conquer strongholds, and unify the world. The key to success in the game is to equip the generals with the right equipment and employ the correct tactics for battle. Players can improve their chances by buying game items to upgrade their generals’ levels and receive game rewards for successful battles. They can also stake their MAT to receive rewards and reinvest them into improving their generals.The generals in the game are non-fungible tokens with attributes like health points (HP), strength, intelligence, defense, attack abilities and technique. The combination of these attributes shapes the color, strength, and combat ability of the generals. Players can either create new generals or buy and sell them from the game’s NFT marketplace. New generals are made by combining two generals of the same type. Players do not need to spend any money to start playing My Master War. However, a small sum is required if players wish to buy in-game items to upgrade their levels. Moreover, players can earn currency through staking MAT, winning challenges, selling NFTs, and referring other players to My Master War.Related Pages:Check out Axie Infinity (AXS) — the most popular NFT trading game.Check out My DeFi Pet (DPET) — a pet-oriented trading game.Read our deep dive into the top metaverses.Get the latest crypto news and latest trading insights with the CoinMarketCap blog.How Many My Master War (MAT) Coins Are There in Circulation?The total supply of MAT is 100 million.

However, none of these trends have captured the immediate and tangible imagination of the general public like non-fungible tokens(NFTs) have. Akin to how bitcoin has challenged the existing notion of money, NFTs are now on track to challenge the fundamental notion of ownership.To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Refinable.With the massive excitement at NFT projects such as NBA TopShots and SoRare, where real-world content is tokenized into certifiably ownable NFTs, communities have demonstrated that digital collectibles can draw immense value from a shared understanding of value and context. It has been exciting seeing communities ranging from gaming to digital art, music to memes all begin to engage in leveraging NFT technology to create and tokenize content for their users. With the NFT market still in its infancy, we as a community should continue to enable and foster playful experimentation to unlock the deepest potential of NFTs.However, as more communities and users begin to interact with existing NFT projects, the issue of scalability and mass onboarding becomes apparent. Etherereum transaction fees have been skyrocketing due to massive activities in other blockchain projects, causing the average users to pay upwards of $60USD for creating or transacting an NFT token. Platform commission fees have been equally exorbitant, while other users wait for months to be verified on select platforms - so we decided to create a one-stop NFT solution addressing these and much more.Without further ado, we are excited to officially announce the public reveal of our project.As the first major NFT hub on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Refinable is the definitive platform to create, discover, trade, and leverage any digital content on the blockchain. We believe in bringing about the adoption of NFTs for the masses whilst also allowing for the communal experimentation of this new medium. This means providing our users with a next-gen platform that can support the next billion users in their NFT endeavors, and this is how it begins.No-Code Decentralized P2P MarketplaceUltra-Low Transaction & Commission FeesLimitless Creation & Distribution OptionsMultiple Settlement CurrenciesCustomized RoyaltiesNFT Content AgnosticCommunity Moderation & IP ProtectionCommercial & Non-Commercial Rights and much more…</td>

Activity of the players will be measured by a special unit - “StarTerra Energy” which is going to affect their chance of winning allocation to buy IDO tokens over the less committed faction members. In this way, StarTerra intends to introduce competition not only between tiers, but also inside each of them.

Another way StarTerra is supposed to provide to the users a feeling of the real computer game is gamified NFT integration. Every Player after connecting his wallet, choosing his unique nickname and avatar will be able to go to “my inventory” section and upgrade his character by adding special NFT tokens to his inventory. These NFTs will come in the form of skins that include Weapons, Armour, Creatures or Artefacts. They will also represent a utility, which means players by adding NFTs will be able to boost their leaderboard scoring and in effect obtain higher allocation to buy IDO tokens. The revenue generated from these NFTs sales will go to the funding of play2earn feature. Top leaderboard players from each faction and all Whalecraft members will earn $UST stablecoin for their active participation in IDO. This means that by participating in an IDO players will not only gain allocation to purchase IDO tokens of the IDO projects but also earn a payout in $UST - decentralized stablecoin pegged with the U.S. dollar.</td>

Each Rune has a supply of 100,000 or less, and players can earn Runes by competing against other players, joining guilds, participating in yield farms, and community participation.The Rune universe consists of Rune Evolution, a play-to-earn game, Rune Farm, the yield farm, Runewords (NFTs), and the Rune Infinite Arena, a player-versus-player game. The team is also developing the Rune Sanctuary, an MMORPG that will be launched in 2022. Currently, Rune is running on BSC, but the team sees the universe as blockchain-agnostic and is building a bridge to Polygon. Who Are the Founders of Rune?Rune’s founders are anonymous. The team chose to stay anonymous to protect itself, its associates, and users from “archaic legislation imposed by governments who won’t understand the emerging DeFi field for years to come.” The team alludes to “Binzy,” which is their fill-in for the person(s) behind Rune, a real software engineer with 20 years of experience and connections in the crypto world. In total, the team consists of 12 people: the lead dev, four unity developers, a React developer, a Solidity developer, two consultant developers, two consultant project managers, one marketing manager, one community manager, four mods and some advisorsWhat Makes Rune Unique?Rune offers an attractive mix of blockchain gaming, NFTs, and elements from decentralized finance. Its universe is split into four different parts.Rune Evolution is a play-to-earn game and was the first game built for the ecosystem. You start as a dragonling that can fly around and eat sprites to evolve into a dragon eventually. One round in the web browser-based game lasts five minutes, and players can earn crypto as a reward.Rune Farm is the yield farm that attracts liquidity to the ecosystem. You can acquire runes through providing liquidity and raiding farms, i.e., yield farming. The team promises that since the supply of runes is limited, their price should find a bottom. Moreover, each rune has its specific utility, and runes can also be combined to build Runewords. Furthermore, for 2022, an online RPG built around runes is in development.Runewords (NFTs) are unique weapons and armor. Each Runeword is suitable for a specific hero class (seven different hero classes exist) or style of play. Runewords improve a hero’s capabilities in battle and offer improved farming and merchant abilities. Runewords are shared, collected, and traded in the Rune Market and players will soon be able to lend them to others. Runewords are crafted from runes.Finally, the Rune Infinite Arena is a player-versus-player, web-based 2D topdown game, where you battle your opponents for prizes. Once you defeat an opponent, they go back to the beginning while you can continue the path that goes on infinitely. The last one standing after one minute of battle claims a reward in the form of crypto or NFTs. Every 15 minutes, you enter a new arena.Related Pages:Check out Axie Infinity (AXS) — a pet-oriented trading game incorporating NFTs.

The original 10,000 RUNE were locked for five years using DxLock. The team launched RUNE as an experiment to bootstrap the ecosystem and create a community. It plans to split RUNE into Rune Shards (RXS) on Polygon in a 1:10,000 ratio. RXS could then be used as payments and rewards in games throughout the Rune Universe. RUNE incurs a 1% transfer fee and up to 1% vault fee, including a 0.1% charity fee and a 0.1% developer fee. This fee goes to the vault, where it is used to fund marketing, development, and community-building events.How Is the Rune Network Secured?RUNE is a BEP-20 token on the Binance Smart Chain.

            <td>What Is Warena (RENA)?Warena is a strategy game on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which has a combination of play-to-earn and metaverse elements. On top of that, Warena also provides a unique level of personalization and the possibility to carry over NFTs from other metaverses. Warena features a fantastical action-survival gameplay, released in two phases. Its first phase is a 2D tower defense game set in the year 2129, in the so-called Survival Phase. After the Earth has descended into World War 3 and witnessed the widespread use of biological and nuclear weapons, it has turned into a post-apocalyptic scenery, with the remaining humans fighting zombies for survival. Players have to cooperate with robots to collect glass spheres, the in-game currency, to level up the robots’ engines, and optimize machine parts. The second phase will take place after a Big Bang that fragments the universe into different dimensions and creates the game’s metaverse, where different tribes like fairies, demons, and humans are present. Warena presents a very detailed roadmap that would see several phases in the game’s development. Here is an excerpt of the most important ones:Launching the V1 of the game in Q4 2021Launching the V1 of the metaverse in Q2 2022Launching V2 in Q3 2022, accompanied by the release of new roles and elementsLaunching new gameplay modes and AR elements after Q4 2022Who Are the Founders of Warena?Warena is a Vietnamese project that is a collaboration of an experienced game studio (d2mstudio), a software development agency (ncc.asia), and experienced blockchain advisors. Among Warena’s advisors are Minh Doan, former co-founder of Harmony (ONE), Chao Ma, ex-CTO of Deeper Network (DPR), and Rong Jian Lan, the current CTO of Harmony. Moreover, Warena boasts an impressive array of backers and partners: DAO Maker, Infinity Capital, RedKite, Binance, Clovers Ventures, and several others. The project also hired two dedicated tokenomics advisors with several years of experience in the finance industry with a combined $15 million in raised capital in IDOs between them.What Makes Warena Unique?Warena offers an interesting combination of several major trends in the blockchain sector. On the one hand, players can earn a digital income from the game’s vast metaverse and strategic gameplay modes. There are several modes available, such as PvE, PvP, and Arena Tournaments. Tokens collected can also later be converted to NFTs and traded on Warena’s marketplace. On the other hand, Warena enables players to create their own characters, but also meet, interact with, and battle characters from other games like Axie Infinity, My Defi Pet, or Cat Gunner. Unique characters are highly customizable down to their avatar, warrior attributes, gear, and skilly. Warena strives to set itself apart from the growing influx of play-to-earn games by launching two-phased gameplay consisting of a tower defense game and a metaverse. Players will be able to purchase and trade virtual land in the metaverse, while the survival game mode focuses more on improving their unique NFT characters in battles.Moreover, Warena aspires to be a community-governed game, where the community manages the so-called WR Community Council in a DAO model. In doing so, players will directly influence the game’s comprehensive roadmap, which targets several new gameplay modes and playable races in the future.

RENA is the game’s governance token that can also be staked. RENA holders also accrue 5% of the revenue Warena incurs. The only way to access rewards in RENA in-game is to stake NFT characters that are rated legendary. The WARE token is the game’s utility token and is used as an off-ramp for players that want to cash out their accumulated in-game rewards. Players will also use WARE on the internal marketplace when trading NFTs. There are several mechanisms to reduce its circulating supply and retain the financial value and element of scarcity of WARE. Battle actions must be paid for in WARE, as do temporary multipliers to stats enhancers and access to different gameplay areas or contests. Each time this happens, 20% of WARE goes to the treasury, and the rest is burned.How Is the Warena Network Secured?RENA is a BEP-20 token on the Binance Smart Chain. BSC is secured through the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. 21 validators are elected every 24 hours to validate transactions and maintain blockchain security. These validators have to stake a certain amount of BNB coins with Binance to be eligible. The game itself runs on the Chromia blockchain, which is a standalone blockchain acting as a layer-two enhancement for BSC. It is a particularly popular choice among blockchain games for its efficient scaling mechanism and the option to set fee structures variably.
